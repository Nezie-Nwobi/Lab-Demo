# Lab-Demo
This repository contains code blocks and steps to deploy VMs with Terraform and make custom configurations and package installation with Ansible.

In the Ubuntu-Config folder, we have the terraform code to deploy multiple VMs on Azure.
In the Ansible folder, we have the Ansible scripts executed by the Ansible playbook for each of the tasks carried out in this lab. Refer to the Ansible Lab Steps file for more details.

The following Tasks were performed in this lab.
1. Deploy 2 VMs on Azure with Terraform.
2. Configure GUI, custom settings and install tools such as docker, nmap, and net-tools on the VMs.
